I am a PhD candidate in the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business and Department of Sociology. My research interests include entrepreneurship and inter-organizational collaboration in emerging markets. I care deeply about the role of businesses in addressing issues associated with environmental sustainability, social inequality, and international development.
