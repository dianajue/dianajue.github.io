			  <br><i>Organization Science</i></div>
				<p>We challenge statistical discrimination theory, which suggests that using all information about job candidates – including social group membership like race or gender – to make predictions. Drawing on heuristics research in psychology, we argue that utilizing less information can be better. We show that even small amounts of decision maker inconsistency and environmental uncertainty can make predictions using group membership less accurate that predictions that do not use this information. That is, using all available information about a job candidate only improves predictive accuracy under a very specific set of conditions, thus suggesting that statistical discrimination often results in worse predictions. By understanding when statistical discrimination improves or worsens predictions, our work cautions decision makers and uncovers paths toward reducing the occurrence of situations in which statistical discrimination benefits predictive accuracy, thus reducing its pervasiveness in society. </p>

				<p>We examine two strategies commonly used in practice by distributors in low-income contexts: 1) improving product affordability through discounts and 2) increasing awareness of products’ value. It is found that among low-income, risk averse customers whose ability to pay is lower than their willingness to pay, there are specific trade-offs to implementing these two strategies. The first strategy only benefits the distributor, while the second strategy may be detrimental depending on customers’ ability to pay and risk aversion. Moreover, in this context, the distributor’s profit-maximizing budget allocation often yields the lowest consumer surplus. This misalignment between profits and consumer surplus disappears if customers’ ability to pay is high. Furthermore, the misalignment can be resolved if the distributor offers free product returns. The results of this model are confirmed through a general model and numerical simulations. </p>

			  <br>3rd Round Revise & Resubmit, <i>Organization Science</i></div>
					<p>I examine whether a market-building institutional intermediary in one country can affect entrepreneurial entry into the nascent industries of other countries. Through an analysis of 109 country-level industries for the innovative product of clean cookstoves between 2013 and 2018, it is found that entrepreneurial entry into the industry is predicted by the number of organizations that operated both in these countries and in countries where an infrastructure-building intermediary also operated. It is argued that the cross-border effects of the intermediary occur through the development of institutional carriers. These institutional carriers take part in a process of inter-organizational evangelism, as they are attracted to the industry-supporting institutional infrastructure established by the intermediary, grow in their acceptance of this institutional infrastructure, and extend elements of this institutional infrastructure to other places where they operate. Empirical analyses additionally show that the effectiveness of institutional carriers on entrepreneurial entry in the nascent industry depends on the carriers’ size and activities, as well as the culture of the countries that receives these carriers. The findings of this research shed new light on institutional carriers and the intermediaries that develop them, and they carry implications for how the growth of industries promoting innovations – especially those that generate health, social, and/or environmental benefits – can be supported globally.</p>

			  <br>Revise & Resubmit, <i>Strategic Management Journal</i></div>
              <p>As social ventures expand to attract new mainstream customers, narratives focused on their original, marginalized customers may limit their growth. We conducted a field experiment with an Indian feminine hygiene company that now serves mainstream urban customers in addition to marginalized rural customers. Among 283 urban participants, we find that its origin story did not lead to enhanced purchase-related outcomes compared to not telling the story, and framing the story around social responsibility reduced participants’ identification as customers. The negative outcomes were driven by stigma transfer; participants transferred bias against rural customers to the venture. The social responsibility framing, however, increased follow-on interest. Our findings suggest that social ventures should carefully frame their origin stories as they approach mainstream customers and devise new growth strategies.</p>

              <div class="subheading mb-3"><b>Jue-Rajasingh, D.</b></div>
              <p>I explore why enterprises led by local entrepreneurs are less likely to receive funding than enterprises led by expatriate entrepreneurs in markets for socially beneficial products. Through an inductive study of emerging clean cooking markets in East Africa, I find that local and expatriate entrepreneurs differ in their familiarity of the lived experiences of their customers and beneficiaries. This possession of deep, local knowledge affects the characteristics and scope of the social problem that their enterprises exist to address, the degree to which their companies are solutions to the identified social problems, and the extent to which customers/beneficiaries are part of the solution as opposed to being recipients of a solution. These contribute to the different choices that local and expatriate entrepreneurs make in terms of the business models they implement and the customers they target. Despite being able to leverage the emerging clean cooking market’s institutional infrastructure to different degrees, both types of entrepreneurs persist in the market – though in different ways. The ongoing presence of both local and expatriate entrepreneurs highlights tensions between the field’s effort to balance social and financial goals and slows market development. However, this creates guardrails for the entire field, making the prioritization of financial goals over social goals much more difficult at the field level, and enables the simultaneous addressing of both immediate and future market needs.</p>

              <div class="subheading mb-3"><b>Jue-Rajasingh, D.</b></div>
              <p>Even though a commitment to improving society and the environment is generally seen as a desirable organizational characteristic, should new ventures always frame themselves in this way? I run a lab-in-the-field experiment with 716 independent retail shops in Bangalore, India and an online experiment with 234 survey takers to test how a venture's use of social impact framing affects the creation of partnerships for selling an innovative water treatment technology. Results show that even within the same stakeholder group, different results arise. In the lab-in-the-field experiment, there was no average effect of the social impact frame, but partnerships decreased when a male representative used it and increased when a female representative used it. In the online experiment, the venture's social impact frame caused an increase in partnerships. To reconcile different outcomes both within and across stakeholder groups, I develop and propose a framework of expertise-based skepticism. This work contributes to growing on entrepreneurial strategy, social claim making, and the legitimation of nascent markets. More broadly, I speak to research on how social issues -- problems and solutions -- can be framed to mobilize support from stakeholders across sectors. </p>

    					<p>In Fall 2020, I was an instructor of record for Corporate Strategy, the University of Michigan Ross School of Business' core course for senior BBA students (teaching evaluation rating: 4.9/5.0). I taught a virtual class of 71 students and had modules on business strategy, corporate strategy, and strategy and society.
						
						<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZBoXZTUXHY" target="_blank">Here</a> is an example of an asynchronous lecture video that students would watch before attending the synchronous virtual sessions, during which we had case discussions and/or live case updates from invited guest speakers. 

						<p>In a Poets&Quants for Undergrads column, one of my BBA students included my Corporate Strategy class as one of the "5 Most Impactful Business Classes" she has taken at Ross. You can read her reflections, as well as an interview with me about my approach to teaching, <a href="https://poetsandquantsforundergrads.com/2021/02/09/ross-reflections-5-most-impactful-business-classes-ive-taken/2/" target="_blank">here</a> (or in <a href="pdfs/Tran_PQColumn.pdf">this PDF</a>).
						
						<p>In Winter 2019, I was an instructor of record for Business Strategy, a University of Michigan Ross School of Business undergraduate core course, and taught 81 sophomore BBA students in-person. I have given guest lectures about my entrepreneurial experiences at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business, INSEAD, and MIT. I was additionally a teaching assistant for Corporate Strategy in the Chinese Context, an elective for undergraduate students, and a grader for Mergers, Acquisitions and Corporate Development, an elective for MBA students.</p>

					<p>To the left is a photo of dusty, unopened improved biomass cooking stoves that were supposed to reduce indoor air pollution. I took it in Tamil Nadu, India where I was conducting field research on the distribution of life-improving technologies.</p> 
          			
					<p>Of the different models that I saw, none were working exceptionally well. Nonprofit organizations gave products away at a subsidized price, and customers didn’t value them. Village level entrepreneurs were difficult to find, unreliable, and hard to scale. Brick-and-mortar stores required too much upfront financing. Most organizations were still pitching these technologies as products for poor people – an unattractive sales strategy.</p>
          			
					<p>I co-founded Essmart to address these problems. The social enterprise creates an essential marketplace for these technologies in places where people already buy their goods -- small stores near where they live. We demonstrate a catalogue of products, distribute to local mom-and-pop stores, and facilitate manufacturers’ warranties. From August 2012 to August 2016, I oversaw operations in southern India. To date, Essmart has positively impact over 1.1 million people people through our network of shops.</p>
