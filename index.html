That is, using all available information about a job candidate only improves predictive accuracy under a very specific set of conditions, thus suggesting that statistical discrimination often results in worse predictions. By understanding when statistical discrimination improves or worsens predictions, our work cautions decision makers and uncovers paths toward reducing the occurrence of situations in which statistical discrimination benefits predictive accuracy, thus reducing its pervasiveness in society.";

The first strategy only benefits the distributor, while the second strategy may be detrimental depending on customers’ ability to pay and risk aversion. Moreover, in this context, the distributor’s profit-maximizing budget allocation often yields the lowest consumer surplus. This misalignment between profits and consumer surplus disappears if customers’ ability to pay is high. Furthermore, the misalignment can be resolved if the distributor offers free product returns. The results of this model are confirmed through a general model and numerical simulations.";

The negative outcomes were driven by stigma transfer; participants transferred bias against rural customers to the venture. The social responsibility framing, however, increased follow-on interest. Our findings suggest that social ventures should carefully frame their origin stories as they approach mainstream customers and devise new growth strategies. <p> <ul><li>Finalist for the Strategic Management Society (SMS) Annual Conference Responsible Research Prize (2024)</li></ul>";

However, these findings do not consider recent developments in stakeholder theory, which suggest that some workers are self-regarding. We propose a new expression of corporate purpose that emphasizes both profitability and benefiting specific stakeholders, including employees. We test how stakeholder reinvestment purpose affects employee attraction by partnering with a US-based care management firm to conduct a large-scale field experiment involving 4,874 job seekers. We find that stakeholder reinvestment purpose attracted the greatest number of job seekers, resulting in more job applications compared to prosocial purpose and financial purpose. Surprisingly, prosocial purpose did not attract more applications compared to no expression of corporate purpose. Additionally, we find that stakeholder reinvestment purpose was particularly effective in attracting blue-collar workers to the firm compared to white-collar workers. Our work implies that when firms recruit employees, specific expressions of corporate purpose have a greater impact on attraction than others. Moreover, firms hiring across different occupational levels may be able to attract blue-collar workers without alienating white-collar workers by leveraging stakeholder reinvestment purpose.";

Through an inductive study of emerging clean cooking markets in East Africa, I find that local and expatriate entrepreneurs differ in their familiarity of the lived experiences of their customers and beneficiaries. This possession of deep, local knowledge affects the characteristics and scope of the social problem that their enterprises exist to address, the degree to which their companies are solutions to the identified social problems, and the extent to which customers/beneficiaries are part of the solution as opposed to being recipients of a solution. These contribute to the different choices that local and expatriate entrepreneurs make in terms of the business models they implement and the customers they target. Despite being able to leverage the emerging clean cooking market’s institutional infrastructure to different degrees, both types of entrepreneurs persist in the market – though in different ways. The ongoing presence of both local and expatriate entrepreneurs highlights tensions between the field’s effort to balance social and financial goals and slows market development. However, this creates guardrails for the entire field, making the prioritization of financial goals over social goals much more difficult at the field level, and enables the simultaneous addressing of both immediate and future market needs.<p><ul><li>Giarratani Rising Star Award Runner-Up, Industry Studies Association Conference (2024)</li>			  <li>Young Scholar Best Paper Award, Indiana University Innovations to Tackle Global Sustainability Challenges Conference (2023)</li><li>Nominated for the Strategic Management Society (SMS) Responsible Research Paper Prize (2022)</li></ul>";

Results show that even within the same stakeholder group, different results arise. In the lab-in-the-field experiment, there was no average effect of the social impact frame, but partnerships decreased when a male representative used it and increased when a female representative used it. In the online experiment, the venture's social impact frame caused an increase in partnerships. To reconcile different outcomes both within and across stakeholder groups, I develop and propose a framework of expertise-based skepticism. This work contributes to growing on entrepreneurial strategy, social claim making, and the legitimation of nascent markets.

    					<p>I teach advanced strategy classes (with a focus on corporate strategy) for undergraduates and MBA students at Rice University. At the University of Michigan, I taught corporate strategy and business strategy for undergraduates. 
						
						<p>I have taught in-person and virtually. In my virtual class, students would watch asynchronous lectures before attending sessions, during which we had a case discussion or live case update. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZBoXZTUXHY" target="_blank">Here</a> is an example of an asynchronous lecture. 

						<p>In a Poets&Quants for Undergrads column, one of my BBA students at the University of Michigan corporate strategy class as one of the "5 Most Impactful Business Classes" she had taken. You can read her reflections, as well as an interview with me about my approach to teaching, <a href="https://poetsandquantsforundergrads.com/2021/02/09/ross-reflections-5-most-impactful-business-classes-ive-taken/2/" target="_blank">here</a> (or in <a href="pdfs/Tran_PQColumn.pdf">this PDF</a>).

					<p>To the left is a photo of dusty, unopened improved biomass cooking stoves that were supposed to reduce indoor air pollution. I took it in Tamil Nadu, India where I was conducting field research on the distribution of life-improving technologies.</p> 
          			
					<p>Of the different models that I saw, none were working exceptionally well. Nonprofit organizations gave products away at a subsidized price, and customers didn’t value them. Village level entrepreneurs were difficult to find, unreliable, and hard to scale. Brick-and-mortar stores required too much upfront financing. Most organizations were still pitching these technologies as products for poor people – an unattractive sales strategy.</p>
          			
					<p>I co-founded Essmart to address these problems. The social enterprise creates an essential marketplace for these technologies in places where people already buy their goods -- small stores near where they live. We demonstrate a catalogue of products, distribute to local mom-and-pop stores, and facilitate manufacturers’ warranties. From August 2012 to August 2016, I oversaw operations in southern India. To date, Essmart has positively impact over 1.1 million people people through our network of shops.</p>
