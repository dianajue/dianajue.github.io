				<p>I  discuss previous failures in social impact technology dissemination, beginning with the Appropriate Technology movement and continuing with the efforts of multinational corporations that have tried selling to low-income "base of the pyramid" customers. Through field research in southern India, I then analyze the efforts and experiments of small and medium enterprises. Finally, I describe my experiences co-founding a social enterprise that distributes social impact technologies in rural areas. </p>
